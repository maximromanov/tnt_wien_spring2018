* Download and install Zotero
* You may need to manually activate Word/OpenOffice plugin for Zotero
* You will need Chrome of Firefox for collecting references from web resources

* In Zotero:
	* Adding references:
		* Using ISBN: **978-1-118-68064-3** (Button: Add Item(s) by Identifier)
		* Using a browser plugin (from Amazon): [try this link](https://www.amazon.com/Companion-Humanities-Blackwell-Companions-Literature/dp/1118680642/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494007367&sr=8-1&keywords=A+Companion+to+Digital+Humanities)
		* Using export functions from [*University of Vienna* Library Catalog](https://usearch.univie.ac.at/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?vid=UWI&afterTimeout=A19EEEF38BD9EA6A9822996C123F1623&dscnt=1):
			1) Search for "A New Companion to Digital Humanities";
			2) open any of the results;
			3) From "Senden am", choose "RIS Export (EndNote, Citavi)";
			4) Double-click on the downloaded file (it should offer to open it in Zotero).
		* Exporting from JSTOR (and automatic PDF download):
			1) go to [http://www.jstor.org/](http://www.jstor.org/);
			2) search for something;
			3) open one of the articles; 4) use the browser plugin to import the record into Zotero:
				- you will need to download the first PDF manually — accept conditions; after that the PDFs will be automatically downloaded into Zotero;
				- for this to work, you need to be either on campus and connect to JSTOR via UniWien's network, or, to be logged in into the UniWien VPN ())
