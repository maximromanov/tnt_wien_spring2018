# 20.03 — [03] Version Control and Collaboration



# General workflow:

* [wwwgithub.com](https://github.com/) :: make an account
* download git software (Windows; Macs usually have it already)
* `fork` a repository
* `clone`
* *work*
* `add`
* `commit`
* `push` / `pull`
* send `pull request`


# Some command line commands

pwd
	shows you where you are on a drive (gives you path)
ls / dir [on Windows]
	shows everything in the your current location/folder
cd <name of the folder>
	takes you to that folder
cd .. 
	takes you one level up in the tree structure of your computer

git commit -m "message"
