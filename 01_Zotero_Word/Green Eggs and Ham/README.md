# 06.03 — [01] Citation Management and Academic Writing I

* Download and install Zotero
* You may need to manually activate Word/OpenOffice plugin for Zotero
* You will need Chrome of Firefox for collecting references from web resources

* In Zotero:
	* Adding references:
		* Using ISBN: **978-1-118-68064-3** (Button: Add Item(s) by Identifier)
		* Using a browser plugin (from Amazon): [try this link](https://www.amazon.com/Companion-Humanities-Blackwell-Companions-Literature/dp/1118680642/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494007367&sr=8-1&keywords=A+Companion+to+Digital+Humanities)
		* Using export functions from [*University of Vienna* Library Catalog](https://usearch.univie.ac.at/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?vid=UWI&afterTimeout=A19EEEF38BD9EA6A9822996C123F1623&dscnt=1):
			1) Search for "A New Companion to Digital Humanities";
			2) open any of the results;
			3) From "Senden am", choose "RIS Export (EndNote, Citavi)";
			4) Double-click on the downloaded file (it should offer to open it in Zotero).
		* Exporting from JSTOR (and automatic PDF download):
			1) go to [http://www.jstor.org/](http://www.jstor.org/);
			2) search for something;
			3) open one of the articles; 4) use the browser plugin to import the record into Zotero:
				- you will need to download the first PDF manually — accept conditions; after that the PDFs will be automatically downloaded into Zotero;
				- for this to work, you need to be either on campus and connect to JSTOR via UniWien's network, or, to be logged in into the UniWien VPN (virtual private network)
				- if there is something like "Access provided by Universität Wien" on the page (check the top of the page), you are good to go.
		* Now, collect a few references.
* In Word/OpenOffice:
	* Paste the text from `McCarty_Modeling.txt` into Word/OpenOffice
	* Open `McCarty_Modeling.pdf` — we'll be using this one as a guide.
	* Working with styles: adding and modifying styles
	* Changing margins
	* Inserting footnotes
	* Inserting citations from Zotero
	* Inserting Bibliography from Zotero
	* Regenerating/Updating bibliography
	* Changing styles
	* Adding page numbers 

# Homework

* Finish conversion of the text into a proper Word document.
* Manage references and bibliography with Zotero.
* Email finished Word file to the instructor (*preferable*: upload to Moodle).
* Generate a separate bibliography file with Zotero ( [1] select all references that you want to include; [2] right-click > "Create Bibliography from Items" > Choose Citation Style, Output Mode, Output Method (Save as RTF)). This will generate a separate file with your bibliography.
* Email the bibliography file to the instructor (*preferable*: upload to Moodle).
